# Project Guidelines

## Coding Conventions
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code formatting and style.
- Prefer type annotations for functions and methods.
- Write descriptive docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions.
- Use meaningful variable and function names; avoid abbreviations unless standard.
- Ensure tests cover new functionality and maintain high code readability.

## Branching Strategy
- Name feature branches using the pattern `feature/<topic>` (e.g., `feature/improve-logging`).

## Pull Request Requirements
- Every PR description must include a **Summary** section detailing the changes.
- Every PR description must include a **Testing** section listing the tests or checks performed.
